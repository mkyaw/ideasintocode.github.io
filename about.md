Hi! My name is Myo (m y OO). 

I am a full stack developer with experience in creating innovative web apps and landing pages. Currently, I am working on projects that use React JS, Angular JS, Laravel, Rails, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Docker.

I will try to post here some of the things that I have learned while writing code. I really hope this will help me consolidate my learning and help someone learn a thing or two.

Thank you for visiting.
